Effortlessly manage, back up, and share your development projects without breaking a sweat! Shlerp eliminates the repetitive and error-prone steps involved in creating clean archives of your work, offering a fast and efficient alternative to traditional GUI methods or manual scripting.

## üöÄ What is Shlerp?

Whether you're collaborating on code, archiving your progress, or sharing projects with others, Shlerp makes it as easy as typing a single command.

Key Benefits:

- Instant Archiving: Create project backups or archives by typing shlerp in your terminal.
- Language Detection: Automatically detects the project's languages/frameworks and applies tailored exclusion rules.
- Customizable Rules: Define your own file-matching rules to suit unique project needs.
- Cleaner Backups: Excludes unnecessary or sensitive files (e.g., .env, IDE-specific files) by default while keeping Git-related ones.
- Flexible Destinations: Easily specify where your archives or backups should go.
- Fast Sharing: Generate single-use download links for projects under 2GB‚Äîideal for remote collaboration.
- Git-Like Simplicity: A perfect alternative when Git feels too heavy-handed for small, quick, or ad-hoc project transfers.

Supported by default:
Frameworks: Ionic (Cordova/Capacitor), React Native, Flask, Spring boot Laravel
Programming languages: Python, Javascript, Java, Rust, PHP

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements:

- Python 3 (highly recommended)
- Bash or Zsh (Windows shells & file system are not supported)

Note: if you're using another UNIX/Linux shell than bash or zsh, you'll have to find a way to make the function in alias.sh available throughout your whole system.

## üöÄ Quick Installation

1. To install the CLI on your system, open a terminal and make sure you're using bash or zsh:

   ```
   echo "$SHELL"
   ```
2. Clone the repository and install Shlerp:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/synka777/shlerp-cmd.git && cd shlerp-cmd && python3 setup.py
   ```
3. Restart your terminal, and you're ready to go!

## üóÑ Use cases

Shlerp simplifies common workflows:

1. Clean Project Duplicates

Want to create a quick copy of your Node.js project without the bulk of `node_modules`?

3. Generate a Quick Share Link

Send your latest code updates to a collaborator via a single-use download link:

```
shlerp -u
```

4. Automated Backups

Back up your active development folders to an external drive using a simple command (great for `cron` jobs):

```
shlerp -b -o /dev/disk1s1
```

## üåü Why Use Shlerp?

Unlike Git or GitHub, Shlerp is designed for simplicity and speed when:

- You need a quick local copy or archive without version control overhead.
- Sharing a temporary project snapshot is faster than pushing to a remote repository.
- Automating backups is more relevant than detailed commit history.

For developers who juggle multiple tools and workflows, Shlerp ensures your files are ready to share, archive, or backup without the hassle.
